# Jot

## Description
    Typically project management systems are built for developers and programmers. They focus in a on using terms within those industries, full of features and design elements and target a very specific market: themselves. Jot is a project management/list/note app built so simply that anyone can use it, we built this with every person in mind. If anyone has a project, activity, or list they want to keep up with, they can create an account and use Jot to track it! 

## How it works
    Once you've created an account and logged in, you'll land on the main page. Here is where you'll see the names of each project/note/list you're working on. The plus sign at the top will add a new project/note/list and the trash can will delete one. For simplicity, the user could stop here and just have 1 main list that they add indivudal items to. Or by clicking the note, it will take you to the content inside of that note. 
    
    Once there you'll see a very familiar lay out. You'll see the names of each section inside of that specific project/note/list, a plus sign to add a new section and a trashcan to delete a section. Just like before, clicking a section will take you further into it. Each section will allow the user to add more notes or sections to it so on and so on, allowing the user to be as fully detailed or simplified as he/she desires. 

    Adding even more customization, in the account settings of the app the user can change the color scheme from light to dark and more!
